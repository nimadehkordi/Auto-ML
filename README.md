# Automated Architecture search and Hyperparameter optimization
## Dataset
[KMNIST](https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist) dataset is a replacement of famous MNIST dataset. This dataset consists of old japanese Hiragana characters which are extracted from old textbooks. Just like MNIST dataset it contains 70,000 28*28 grayscale images with 10 classes in total.

More information and links to download the dataset can be found at the GitHub page of the dataset linked above.

## DARTS
[DARTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09055) is a differentiable architecture search methods which searches for a good architecture given some basic cells and stacking up those cells to optimize a novel architecture.

## BOHB
[BOHB](https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter) is a framework for hyperparameter optimization which fuses Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with bandit-based configuration evaluation approach to acheieve strong anytime performance and fast convergence to optimal configurations.
